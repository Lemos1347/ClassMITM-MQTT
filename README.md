# ClassMITM-MQTT
This repository contains code to simulate a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack using MQTT for a class at Inteli University. The simulation includes a producer, a listener, and a Man-in-the-Middle component. The messages exchanged between the producer and the listener are encrypted using the Caesar cipher.
